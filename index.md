# Real World ðŸ¤¯

Hello, I go on the internet by Reality Gamer (kind of over this name might modify it soon) or Realboy. 
This is the home page for my various projects. I am working on a writing-machine which consists of several co-enveloping assemblages.

Generally speaking I am interested in sociocultural structures and technology. I hope for my writing to establish new lines to traverse upon which we may discover new potentials for these systems.
