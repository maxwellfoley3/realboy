			<b>§1</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		In his final interview before his death, Heidegger famously lamented that, after spending his lifetime seeking to find a solution for how man could survive the planetary encounter with modern technology, the only answer he could find was that  "Only a God can save us".
		</p>
		<p>
		The task of this text, as we prepare for the universe to sweep itself away to a culmination of global  civilization, is to figure out how we can make the necessary space for this god to appear.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>§2</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		We seem to be still amidst the beginning of, but yet well into the process of making some kind of break with the human condition into a world defined and governed by something else.
		</p>
		<p>
		A few observations follow.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the West, under modernity, God has been replaced as the proper figure conceived as governing worldly affairs, having been long ago usurped by Man. This is Enlightenment humanism: the notion that man, with his reason and his sciences, has all he needs at his disposition to take the throne of the world, to steer the ship of civilization into ever grander heights. But Man no longer seems to be in charge at all, and no new god has come to save us yet by replacing him. The world instead seems to be ruled by a combination of market forces and imminent possibilities within technological development, and there is no single man or functioning collective of men who is capable of going against these forces if they disagree with them.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, the development of artificial intelligences like GPT-4 has indisputably shown that machines are able to perform complex reasoning tasks more capably than many humans. The question remains if they will eventually eclipse us entirely; if they will need us at all. In any case, a fundamental distinction that has always existed between mind and internet matter has collapsed — we are no longer the only thing that thinks.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is just the most obviously eschatological new break we have to wrestle with. Technology, having long ago precipitated the destruction of most traditional ways of life, is now wrecking what might be called a *universal crisis in all forms*. No entity like the mind, the person, the body, the family, the citizen, the state, the human can be said to have its coherence ensured at this point. The specter of radical transhuman body-alteration seems to already at hand with the increasing numbers of people who are embracing transsexuality and its rejection of natural ways of categorizing the body. Despite America’s ostensible commitment to the individual’s right to pursue happiness, this has led to a sociopolitical crisis of sorts in which “what is a woman?” became a debated question in Congress — the basic definitions of what mankind *is* now turned into a contentious political battleground.
		</p>
		<p>
		The internet seems to have led to a crisis in the concept of democracy that Western states are grounded upon — with technology having given citizens more ability to express their voices than ever, it seems as if fundamental incoherences in this form of governance have been exposed. Having stripped the shrine of the state of its vestments, technocapital now tentatively declares it does not need the state at all. There is the exit-libertarianism of Bitcoin and the adjacent “network state” concept as an increasingly threatening movement against 20th centuries of sovereignty, but even without this, it is theorized by some, eg Samo Burja, that the endgame of Amazon is to become a full-fledged replacement for the US government, as technocapital on its surface seems vastly more efficient than sclerotic 20th century bureaucracies in nearly all the functions required for maintaining civilization.
		</p>
		<p>
		Most people seem to behold all this with a sense of doom, and there is perhaps no clear reason why they shouldn’t. Enthusiasts of technology will remind us of the comforts and conveniences that each development grants us. It is true that, through a streamlining of user experience, it is much more convenient to use the Uber app than it is to hail a taxi, and this represents some improvement in daily life. But the degree of qualitative change from the pre-smartphone experience in this particular situation pales in its depth of intensity to the degree of qualitative change that comes from having, for instance, the center of social life and the discursive commons anchored in a handful of apps all with perverse incentives for engagement, a virtual plane of information-space within which people now spend much of their waking hours ambiently immersed in. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The smartphone has become the first widely adopted cybernetic appendage. No clear distinction between time using it and time without it is possible anymore. Our perception and means of navigating the world is now mediated through having it as an extension of us at all times — no longer does one need to memorize street signs and landmarks to make one's way through the world, as one can simply let the Maps app guide you. Whether one is "optimistic" or "pessimistic" about this state of affairs is surely a reductive set of possible remarks in comparison to the vast amount of qualitative, phenomenological, and poetic observations one can make about how our means of relating to the world has been transformed — though these are less frequently made than complaints or nostalgic laments over what has been lost.
		</p>
		<p>
		With no one stepping up to even pretend as if they are capable of steering the developments of this technology, we face a situation in which the earth is becoming alien to us, we are rapidly becoming alien to ourselves,  and there is absolutely no one that can safeguard the shelter of our being, everything we know and value. Today's tech "elite" is surely one of the most lacking in social responsibility and noblesse oblige that the West has ever had, as they do not even try to convince the world that the machines they are enthusiastically building aren't going to destroy the world. They present the decision to build potentially apocalyptic strong artificial intelligence as something that is not a choice at all, as if it is a decision technology has made for itself that they are reluctant vessels of. Unfortunately, it seems more reasonable to take the stance that they are roughly correct than to blame them for their moral failings — again, it seems as if Man as steward of his world has been entirely displaced. Whatever trajectory the planet is taking is constructed by such an overdetermined logic imminent to the system that the richest and most powerful capitalists alive feel impotent against it.
		</p>
		<p>
		Presented with this picture of impotence in the face of planetary technology, some choose to simply embrace their impotence: this is the origin of the school of thought called accelerationism. Originally conceived of by Nick Land as a misanthropic, Satanic philosophy that chooses to fully embrace man's death-drive: acceleration says that there is no possibility of avoiding extinction from technology, and so we might as well choose to lean into it and enjoy the rush. What was once an obscure form of nihilism for bookish melancholics is now embraced by the technocapitalist elite, who proudly identify as accelerationists now, shamelessly announcing their helplessness to the world when it comes to controlling or even understanding the monsters they build.
		</p>
		<p>
		It is obvious that the only meaningful intervention in the grand arc of history that might possibly take place to shape the future of existence can only happen with and through a transformative intervention into the field of contemporary technology. Unless one can say something about how to approach this, one is only saying something mere, something trivial and distracting. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But it is totally inconceivable to imagine how this intervention might happen on a large enough scale. Our thoughts are blocked by a simplistic binary between private and public — either we face the market and the field of technological development thus plays out as an anarchy amongst competing innovating firms, or all control over production is seized by the yoke of the state under a master plan. Under this logic, unless one can see a path towards conquering the state and adopting total power, there is nothing anyone can possibly do.
		</p>
		<p>
		The purpose of this text is to construct the perspective through which something else is possible — through which an individual reader or group might be able to enact their will upon the field of contemporary technology and enact a creative role in history, something which must become newly possible once more.
		</p>
		<p>
		While it may be the case that man is forever unseated from piloting his planetary destiny — more accurately, it is perhaps like a laughable illusion that he was ever in control to begin with — it is possible that the technological field presents us with more than one possible logic to it. If we cannot figure out how to restore the seat in the universe we once had — if are flung at the mercy of the gods again — it may at least be possible to think more carefully about the nature of this summoning.
