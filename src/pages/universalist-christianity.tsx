    <h1>Towards Universalist Christianity</h1>
    <p>How does Christianity become Universal?</p>
    <p>I was thinking this: the fundamental problem in the West is this gap we have between religion and philosophy. Other cultures don’t have this.</p>
    <p>Guenon says that the reason the West failed to remain a stable Traditional society and developed modernity (ie capitalism) is because it didn’t attach a metaphysics to its religion. Christ didn’t invent a metaphysics, it had to be grafted on from Plato / Aristotle by the church.</p>
    <p>Some binaries</p>
    <li>Philosophy v religion</li>
    <li>Neoplatonism v Christianity</li>
    <li>Metaphysics v poetry</li>
    <li>Rationalism v irrationalism</li>
    <p>You have the presence of the logos on the one side, and the absence of it on the other. And of course the logos is the specifically Western invention, Western man’s reason. But then, according to John, Christ is the logos — what’s up with that? Blake’s thing is to say yes to Christ but fuck the logos, Christianity is poetic and irrational, and the logos and all this metaphysical shit was grafted on by Rome and turned into the oppressor, which is pretty convincing to me, but then what do we do with our God-given reason?</p>
    <p>This is the first aporia. Now let’s look at things in terms of history, and the philosophy of the Event.</p>
    <p>Events have two sides, the ideal and the actual. Ideal Protestantism vs actual Lutheranism. Ideal republicanism vs actual the French Revolution.</p>
    <p>That is to say, we can tell a story in which all of history unfolds through necessary conceptual developments, in a certain Hegelian fashion. Along the way there are all sorts of contingencies, but they are inessential to the story. This is basically the story from the perspective of rationalism. If this story is correct, it means we can use reason to move history forward, which is nice.</p>
    <p>From the perspective of irrationalism, however, the accidents are more interesting than this reason-based story, and if we tell ourselves we understand the reasons for all these endless infinitely complex things which happen on earth, we are deluding ourselves. What is the story of the Jew supposedly born of a virgin dying on a cross and inspiring the largest mass movement in history if not the ultimate accident? How can we possibly rationalize this and make it understood? Of course, a few have tried: the slave revolt in morals.</p>
    <p>The problem with rationalism is that: if you take the philosophical perspective of immanent divinity, that we must bring God-or-Nature further into the world via contemplation, and this will redeem us, you cannot possibly be neutral or ambivalent towards Christianity. It is either something one “believes in”, even with caveats, or it is the most horrible lie and falsehood ever invented. (Hegel takes the first side, Nietzsche the second).</p>
    <p>Liberal normie America types are more on the rationalist side. They like the equation: GOD = LOVE. They like love thy neighbor, they like do unto others, they are extremely grateful to Christ for introducing this all to us in the most pivotal Event in (intellectual) history. But they don’t like the rules with no explanation, they don’t like accepting things on faith, they don’t like the symbols and the rituals, they don’t like particularities as it could smack of exclusion and thus non-universality. As far as I can tell, Ulysse’s project of “woke brutalism” is to give these people Neoplatonism as the grounding rational framework for reason to march on its redemptive arc across the cosmos, alongside the movement of libtardism and associated forces.</p>
    <p>The other problem with the rationalist project is that it culminates in madness, attempting to capture all things into explanations. Terminal wordcel brain is probably not gnosis, but a horrific self-imposed schizo-autistic prison. Reason must continually enter into the contingencies and accidents of the world, all the water droplets on the window and grass and birds, or it is a cage. Chesterton’s Christianity as the ur-romantic poem is good here. Something which is key about religion is that it involves celebrating “whatever this is” — a wedding, a gang, a dance, your toddler’s first attempt at representational imagery, etc.</p>
    <p>So what would a Universal Christianity look like? It would look like a wedding, a Christianity in which the Event of Christianity is somehow:</p>
    <li>- not an accident, or exception</li>
    <li>- but also not entirely reduced to reason</li>
    <p>This would be a new understanding of Christianity, a new interpretation. It’s not entirely clear how this would be possible — we are talking about healing a fundamental gap intrinsic to our condition as Westerners.</p>
    <p>But we could for instance start by doing a new reading of the Event and the concepts of Christianity, in which we take a radical ambivalence between the two sides of reason and religion. We do a historicist reading of the Bible, we have no particular need for faith in miracles right now. But we also take the Christian concepts seriously — extraordinarily so, and elevate them above purely reason-derived concepts, if need be.</p>
    <p>This is like the way Deleuze reads the genesis of various philosophical concepts, and immanentizes them. So then it’s like: we do an immanent Christianity, we find immanent conditions of genesis for the concepts of sin, redemption, grace, providence, the holy spirit , etc., but this would necessarily be an immanent philosophy which opens itself up to and points back towards transcendence (pure immanence is kind of a nonsensical cope to begin with).</p>
    <li>— what is the Event from which this concept derives</li>
    <li>— how does this concept actually function</li>
    <li>— what are the grounds of this concept which establish it as coherent, from a rational perspective</li>
    <li>— why do we find out that this concept is actually <i>impossible to avoid</i>;  that is: even if we try to avoid it, why will we run into it again and again and again?</li>
