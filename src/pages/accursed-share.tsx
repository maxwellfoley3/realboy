		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
		The goal of Accursed Share is to posit a new theory of “general economy”, which is distinguished from standard political economy in that political economy has heretofore only looked at things from the perspective of accumulation or growth, and ignoring the other side of consumption or waste, which Bataille sees as not only essential to consider, but the realm of the sacred, the divine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bataille begins the text with the striking Blake-inspired metaphor of “the tiger is to space what coitus is to time”. According to Bataille, there has never been much of a problem of inability for life to sustain itself and grow. The sun gives the earth an essentially infinite supply of energy to create life, and any form of life which has found a strategy to reproduce itself can easily do so until it saturates its entire environment, like algae across a pond. The predator animal, such as the tiger, is divine because he clears the space for new life to grow and the universe to continue its process of creativity. From the perspective of caloric energetics, the predator animal is a waste; he requires far more calories to sustain his life than grass does. But the cosmic process nevertheless builds him up as a certain temple, an altar upon which great death can happen, and this is holy. (I feel reminded of similar passages in <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i>, in which predator animals are praised for reasons parallel to Renaissance aestheticism and related cultures of opulence, and the author is plagued with the fear that the human race might return to a more “bug-like” form of existence, especially by the spectre of Chinese Communism.)
		</p>
		<p>
		The second part of this dyad, the bit about coitus, has a less clear meaning to me but will presumably be made more clear in the second volume on eroticism. Bataille views sex and death as sacred because they are both waste, from the perspective of general economy. This perspective on death makes clear sense; the organism evacuates this mortal plane to make room for others. The part about sex is less clear. There seems to be a biological aspect where sexual reproduction, similar to predation, represents a caloric overinvestment relative to asexual plant life. There also seems to be a level where Bataille values lovemaking for pleasure as  noble “wasted time” (is the elevation of lovemaking as paradigmatic over all of man’s other frivolous pleasures just a relic of a legacy from psychoanalysis?) One possible answer is that the aspect of lovemaking which perhaps seems most central to Bataille is that he is concerned about a lost state of ontological “intimacy” in which the subject-object divide collapses. More on this later, but Bataille seems to view sacrifice as necessary to achieve this state.

</p>
		<p>
		Continuing with the earlier theme — Bataille writes that it is relatively unproblematic for any system to build up of energetic resources within it, but must make a key decision of how to dispel its excess, which is where the question of defining the sacred (the sacrificial) comes in. If the society cannot make a good decision of how to squander its excess, the excess will overflow into violence or wars of conquest. (The potential dialogue between Bataille and Malthus on population carrying capacities in an ecosystem and how that intersects with political economy is interesting to consider.)

</p>
		<p>
		From here, Bataille presents several chronologically ordered case studies of general economy.

</p>
		<h2>
		Mexican civilization 
		</h2>
		<p>
		Bataille writes about the enormous carnivals of mass human sacrifice which would happen in Aztec civilization, during which thousands of people would be slaughtered yearly atop pyramids as offerings to the gods, as blood would stream in rivers down the steps and executioner-priests would wear the skin of the victims as cloaks while preparing the next one. He describes how the Aztecs conceived of the nobility of sacrifice through a primordial myth in which the greatest of the gods was the one who offered to throw himself into the sun, and thus became the sun.
</p>
		<p>
		Bataille argues that despite being violent, Aztec civilization was prevented from ever becoming a “military”, imperial civilization, ie never developed a military bureaucracy or consistent war ethic, because it squandered its excess manpower in this way. If it had not found a way to sacrifice, the excess of energy would have overflowed into a war machine in this alternative manner.
</p>
<h2>Potlatch</h2>
		<p>
		In early forms of society prior to large civilizational states in many areas, warring tribal chieftains and clans would demonstrate their superiority by their ability to waste, often by giving gifts to one another, but in certain extreme cases there was pure waste, including a practice iirc among certain Native Americans where if a warrior chieftain came face to face with a rival he would announce his presence by cutting the throat of one of his slaves in the view of his rival.

</p>
<p>
Bataille writes that, in gift-giving, one loses resources from the perspective of restricted economy, but one gains from the perspective of general economy, because one is able to put the gift recipient in debt to oneself, or at least induce a feeling of obligation and inferiority. There becomes a whole economy of “rank” which is preferable to ascend in over mere accumulation of goods.
</p>
<p>
At the end of this chapter, Bataille writes that the most noble life is that of the loafer who utterly scorns money and makes a ridiculous waste of his life, because he is able to reveal the “lie” that wealth is. Wealth to Bataille (including the spiritual wealth of “rank”? Need to re read) is a lie insofar as it demands to eventually be spent and sacrificed, and reveals its truth only in the way it is consumed.
</p>
<h2>Islamic civilization</h2>
<p>
Bataille, in seeming contrast to the Mexican civilization described above, illustrates Islam as a situation in which the excess of society is turned into a disciplined war bureaucracy for conquest. He writes that we could perhaps just as easily cite the Roman Empire as the case study for a warlike society and the Christian Church for the subsequent study of a society of peace and renunciation, but that picking unfamiliar non-Western examples can illuminate the dynamics better for the reader.
</p>
<p>
Bataille says that there is a paradox from the perspective of the Western aesthetic observer, which is that we observe a lot of beauty and poetry and love of life in Islamic civilization, but it is hard to discover how this attitude could have derived from the Quran, with its attitude of severity and total submission to God. Bataille argues that Arab civilization has a tendency towards pleasure and opulence and frivolousness, and it was the achievement of Mohammad to take all of the slack out of the Arab’s way of life and refocus the energy of the Arab men towards jihad. Once the jihad was fully accomplished, in the sense that the Arabs had built an empire and there was nowhere left to conquer, the slack inevitably went back into the system and the ways of the lives of the men returned partially to their original free state, leading to the current paradox in which we see a natural poetic Arab sensibility and the severity of Islam seemingly superimposed.
</p>
<h2>Lamaism</h2>
<p>
In contrast to Islam, we are presented with the Tibetan society, which is unique for having never gone to war. Bataille explores a lengthy analysis of the geopolitics of Tibet and its diplomatic relations with Britain and China which allowed it to remain free from invasion while not keeping an army. However, due to needing to retain these relations under the wings of major powers, Tibetan sovereignty has always been somewhat illusory, with their affairs mostly governed by external powers and their kings limited to playing a sacred ceremonial role.
</p>
<p>
Though the geographic isolation seemingly ensured that Tibet could never become a military power, it was only able to remain peaceful through squandering its excess in enormous amount of resources allocated to the church, including celibate clergy living opulent lives fueled by the labor of Tibetan peasants. When the thirteenth Dalai Lama in the early 20th century attempted to work with British Orientalists sympathetic to Tibet to figure out how to transform Tibetan society into one which was capable of exerting actual sovereignty, Tibet experienced mass protest by the monks as well as the populace, who loved the monks, because this would mean a shift of resources from the church into war and infrastructure, which would mean the loss of the uniquely church-centric Tibetan way of life.
</p>
<h2>Calvinism</h2>
<p>
Bataille repeats Max Weber’s analysis of the origin of capitalism in the Protestant work ethic. Bataille seems far more sympathetic to Catholic society and views the Protestant reformation as a sort of abandonment of God from the earth. Under Catholicism, there would be regular sacrifices of wealth in the form of building cathedrals and funding the lives of the clergy. But in Protestantism, all wealth is reinvested for productivity, leading to a dangerous situation from the perspective of general economy. “You know white people, get money, don’t spend it”.
</p>
<p>
Here we get to Bataille’s notion of how “intimacy” ties into his concept of sacrifice. Bataille seems to believe that while man originally existed in a state of “intimacy” with everything, this is now rarely felt and we only experience it when there is a suspension in the normal logic of production, or the logic of “things”. When inside a cathedral, one is able to experience intimacy, because the building was created as a sacrifice, and thus a gift given over to you — in contrast to a barn, which is a building created for the logic of production. (The attitude here seems nearly identical to that of the late Heidegger’s question concerning technology, although Heidegger makes the opposite, counter-intuitive move of using the term “thing” exclusively to describe sacred objects.)
</p>
<p>
Bataille blames Calvin over Luther as specifically being “the Mohammed of the bourgeois”, in that he gave them a relationship to God which removed all the slack from their lives and turned them into a war machine to conquer the earth. The new Calvinist relationship with God is an entirely interiorized one, which accepts the imperative, the duty, of constant production as a requirement for entering the next world, and as such, God is evacuated out of this earth and there are no more cathedrals.
</p>
<h2>The bourgeois world</h2>
<p>
The bourgeois world is fundamentally self contradictory, because it is characterized by a rejection of luxury, following the Protestant work ethic, but also in actual fact, the presence of luxury. Thus the bourgeois is a confused person with an incoherent consciousness. It is perhaps inevitable that this consciousness be succeeded by something like the clearer Marxist one, in which luxury is fully abandoned and the bourgeois casts off or is forced to cast off their implicit claim to a luxurious life.
</p>
<h2>The Soviet Union</h2>
<p>
Bataille characterizes Marxism as an intensification of the logic of capitalism, or production, or the logic of “things”, rather than its rejection. Marx, who is delicately mystical at times, seems to imagine that if the logic of production is carried out to its full intensity, it will allow for the easy accumulation of enough resources that man will be able to spend more time idle than he ever has before. Thus, a sphere of the “full human”, once in which “intimacy” is restored, can potentially be created by stripping the sphere of production of everything that is external to it. This attitude would represent the intensification of the Calvinist submission to the logic of production and rejection of luxury that the bourgeois, in their confused consciousness, is unwilling to do.
</p>
<p>
Bataille also notes that this revolutionary Marxist attitude is in opposition to much of the left in social-democratic countries, who advocate for more luxury, more squandering, more free time for the workers rather than the properly “accelerationist” attitude to production of Marx.
</p>
<p>
Politically, Bataille seems sympathetic to the ideal of socialism prior to Lenin but contemptful of the Soviet Union, to the point of leaning on the side of the capitalist powers. Writing in 1949, he seems to be taking a similar standpoint to many commentators prior to the West consolidating its Cold War position in which Stalin is portrayed as totally fearsome and poised to conquer the earth. Bataille seems to have an attitude that while Stalinist civilization is clearly dismal and disturbing “at least it’s an ethos”, and the capitalist West is able to offer nothing as an alternative yet other than a vague anxiety.
</p>
<p>
That being said, Bataille presents an unusual defense of Stalin. As with Islamic civilization, Stalin has turned the East into a massive war machine, through a rapid buildup of industrial production. But Bataille argues that this was in retrospect necessary to do, because Russia rapidly went from being an undeveloped “backwards” country to successfully defending itself at Stalingrad from genocidal total warfare. Stalin saw the existential need for Russia to defend itself coming, and also knew that to build up a war machine in this service would require a sacrifice from each person that no one would be talked into freely, thus terror and oppression had to be made the order. Bataille argues that after the awkward outcome of revolutionary socialism only being established in one country, and specifically an agrarian one lacking a war industry, there would have been no possible way for the revolution to defend itself other than Stalinism, and thus Stalin is a loyal knight of the revolution, rather than its betrayer according to the Trotskyite narrative. 
</p>
<h2>The Marshall Plan</h2>
<p>
Despite knowing that this makes him a “madman”, Bataille conceives of the Marshall Plan as a solution to re-arming Europe against Stalin’s military might as a kind of divine revelation (he says “apotheosis”). This is because the capitalist powers have chosen to make a break from the logic of only investing in more production, in order to “invest in the world” through a gift, or a sacrifice. Bataille seems to think that through this decision, the laws of general economy will finally be fully known to the world as a self-conscious framework for decision-making. (It’s unclear to me exactly how this thesis may or may not need to be revised in light of the subsequent events of the Cold War.)
</p>
<h2>Bataille’s moral and spiritual position</h2>
<p>
Bataille is a figure who invites a lot of speculation with regards to what his positive ambition for society actually is. Many seem to read him as a pervert who is interested in destruction, chaos, criminality for its own sake. Certainly he has moments which invite the reading of him as a Satanist, such as in <i>Story of an Eye</i> when the protagonists rape and murder a Catholic priest on an altar, or his founding of a secret society around the concept of human sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
However, at the same time it seems clear that Bataille is deeply invested in Christian ethical themes around his concepts of the sacred and sacrifice; the sacrifice of wealth, and the sacrifice of the body in death, as in Christ’s sacrifice. Bataille was a devout Catholic for nine years and briefly entered seminary, aiming for the priesthood. In other texts, such as <i>The Solar Anus</i>, Bataille references Christ with the name “the Jesuve”, potentially in order to strip him of historical particularly and turn him into a conceptual persona, or perhaps to eliminate existing connotations of significance attached to the name.
</p>
<p>
What Bataille seems to me to be is a gnostic Christian in the tradition of sects in the first two centuries after Christ prior to the consolidation of the Christian position by the Roman church. (Phillip K Dick is a similarly situated neo-gnostic who is rough contemporaries with Bataille). The gnostics were characterized by fully rejecting all existing logic of Roman society, its institutions, and accumulation of wealth (in accordance with the teaching of Christ), as well as believing they could supersede the teaching of the Gospels and the existing letter through further revelations directly experienced. They also used sex magic and orgies as a way to reach God. Though they believed in a divine anarchy in which they obeyed no law and were free as God himself, there is not a record of them using this infinitely free mandate to justify cruelty, even amongst their unorthodox and often disturbing sex practices.
</p>
<p>
Gnostic Christianity has been widely slandered today by polemicists such as Voegelin who define it in essence as “rejection of the material world” and then ahistorically argue that this is the secret kernel of everything bad ever, eg Hitler, Stalin, etc. Even people such as Emilie Carriere on X who should know better repeat this crude jeremiad. This merely repeats the persecutory logic of the early Roman church, who put a label on anything which is outside of their consolidated perspective which they violently enforce as heretical, infidel, Satanic, etc.
</p>
<p>
A lot of the debate about what the essence of Gnosticism is reflects an irritating factor with debates around “isms” in general, is that in my experience these anxieties over “isms” are usually entertained by people who “weren’t there, and won’t get it”. People who read texts without participating in sociopolitics directly often feel compelled to internally debate and distinguish between a bunch of fixed “isms” they are receiving secondhand. Whereas people directly involved in sociopolitical life speak of cliques, vibes, individual people etc which are constantly in flux. Similarly, the essence of gnostic Christianity is a claim to have directly experienced revelation — gnostic means “one who knows”. Nor is its history limited to a single revelation, but rather a continuous stream of revelations establishing various sects until its lineage would be extinguished through its persecution by the Roman church. So it does not seem to me like the legacy of gnostic Christianity could be evaluated absent an investigation of each moment of revelation and the various zones of fallout which resulted in each instance, but unfortunately most of this history is now lost.
</p>
<h2>Roadmap for further investigations into Bataille</h2>
<p>
I intend to read most of Bataille’s work, it seems to me like he might be a very crucial figure to build from. I can think of a number of arguments in favor of Bataille being a tentative candidate for figurehead at the helm of a conceptual vehicle which for now might be called “Surrealism NYC”.
</p>
<p>
● We can historicize ourselves as the true heirs of 20th century Surrealism, following Bataille’s exile from Surrealism by Breton (who does Breton think he is, the Pope?)
</p>
<p>
● General economy can be made as the basis to develop Divine Economy from — amazingly, there already is waiting for us the start of a Surrealist theory of political economy.
</p>
<p>
● Something like gnosticism is perhaps a good conceptual handle to continue our investigations under, which delve into spiritual considerations as necessary to ground the ethical, including taking into account the revelatory and so on, without being beholden to dogma, tradition, sects, or even necessarily theism.
</p>
<p>
● Bataille is useful as a non-Marxist theory of political economy that is also critical and redemptive. The fallout with JM has only increased my conviction that Marxist class analysis assigning a destined redemptive role to the poor is at this point irrelevant and poisonous. From a Bataillean perspective, it is perhaps the downwardly mobile bourgeois, trust fund kids etc, who are the revolutionary, or even just divine class, as they alone have the opportunity to grossly squander. Let’s Make A Vibe Shift In Dimes Square.
</p>
<p>
● Similarly, we can argue that 20th century Surrealism failed in its world-historical potential by Breton’s insistence on wedding it to revolutionary Marxism-Leninism. Dali emerging as the most successful Surrealist after explicitly becoming a fascist and then culminating his career with a party at the Rothschild mansion which inspired <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> at the very least indicates that the spirit of Surrealism is not exactly a natural fit with that of doctrinaire revolutionary Marxism. 
</p>
<p>
● Bataille’s attempt at founding an esoteric secret society and later imitation of this model by Nick Land, the remnants of which would eventually become the Urbanomic milieu we are in dialogue with, suggests a potential adventure point for Corporate Surrealist praxis.
</p>
<p>
● Bataille’s “base materialism” has a strong conceptual ring with Lil B’s “based” and “the based God”, who I (I am perfectly aware that this is eccentric) take quite seriously as a conceptual persona and world-historical poet and <a href="https://realitygamer.substack.com/p/based-deleuze">have attempted to synthesize with Nietzschean and Deleuzean ethics on Substack</a>.
</p>
<p>
● Bataille is a direct textual bridge between Blake and Guattari, who have heretofore been the authors I have taken most seriously as developing programs for the improvement (or probably more accurately, redemption) of society.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this is all getting a bit carried away and the destiny of the project should emerge gradually and naturally — I am becoming a bit overexcited.
